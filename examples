TODO:
	Add function to use correct ip. For example to use LAN instead of reverse-proxy at home.

	!!!!Maybe divide main file into multiple for the sake of readability
	And also add a build tool, maybe nob or my own nobuild interpretation	
	
	Clean main function because now it sucks!
	
	Maybe rewrite get_user_pass function!
	
	Make some kind of security check!!!!
		Maybe add a hash of password into config, so it will fine to use, or u will need to write password every time.
		Add a security option to config, like ENABLE_PASS_FROM_CONFIG.
	
	Basic TUI usage
		login
		command
	
	Config usage:
		get login
		command
	
	Custom script
		get login
		find command
		execute command line by line
	
	Add custom requests??
	
	
Basic TUI usage:
sshc user@ip password action serv_path cl_path

[action]
	- get	: get a file if no path then put directly into folder
	- put	: upload a file, needs additional path after
	- ls : if path to a file, just list a whole folder i guess

Using config
sshc login action serv_path cl_path

You can write you custom action in config

START
name
action1
action2
action3
...
END

for example

START
obsidian
put /home/user/Documents/ObsidianVault /home/user/Server/Obsidianvault
END

You can write your own ssh request as a form of a file

START
name
filename c_parameter parameter1 parameter2...
END



Complete cli
sshc login shell

	This will activate UI that looks like MidnightComander with commands like ls, get and put
	Maybe made it not like mc, but rather normal shell with tab key to switch between server and client machine.
